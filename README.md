  * *redux*

    * If each data response is requested everytime whenever the frontend needs it, the server gets much burden and the performace of the program will be hindered.

    * By saving data useful and irrelevant to security, such a problem can be solved. 

    * Furthermore, by using redux each entity in the frontend is managed in global state and can be called out in any component. 

      * file directory
